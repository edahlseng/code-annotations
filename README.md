# Code Annotations ([Atom](http://atom.io) package)

This is an atom package for creating code annotations.
An annotation is a piece of content that has a name and can be displayed in atom.
While working only the name of the code annotation is visible but it can be shown by clicking on the pin icon (in the atom gutter)

![Basic usage](https://github.com/jneuendorf/code-annotations/raw/master/gifs/basic-usage.gif)

By default, this package can render the following kinds of content:

- images
- html
- links / URLs
- plain text

Further renderers can be added by installing code-annotation plugin packages (TODO).
